                                    <p> The International Committee for Non-Destructive Testing (ICNDT) is a non-profit
                                        organisation devoted to the international development of the science and
                                        practice of Non-Destructive Testing in conjunction with individual NDT Societies
                                        and recognized continental groupings of NDT Societies. The ICNDT is registered
                                        as a legalized Association with its seat in Vienna, Austria. The Vision of ICNDT
                                        is to create a safer world through wider use of non-destructive testing (NDT)
                                        and diagnostic technologies and the Mission is to lead a global network of NDT
                                        societies and their regional groups devoted to the promotion of the development
                                        of the science and practice of NDT for the benefit of the public worldwide. As a
                                        branch of engineering that is valuable worldwide, ICNDT would like to make the
                                        public aware of what Non-Destructive Testing is and why it is such an important
                                        component for public safety. ICNDT mostly focuses on fostering cooperation
                                        between NDT Federations, Societies, or other organisations, but public awareness
                                        will also play a role in the future of NDT.</span>

            <p> Keeping the global perspective and demand of NDT, ICNDT is comprised of four
                major regions, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Pan-America and Africa respectively. The
                four Regional bodies - The European Federation for Non-Destructive Testing
                (EFNDT), The Asia Pacific Federation for Non-Destructive Testing (APFNDT), The
                Pan-American Federation for Non-destructive Testing (PANNDT) and African
                Federation of Non-Destructive Testing (AFNDT) coordinate and collaborate with
                ICNDT for most of the activities. While the ICNDT is made up of different
                regional groups, it goes without saying that those groups are formed by
                individual National NDT Societies. As it is ICNDT`s ongoing mission to promote
                NDT worldwide having a strong base is of importance and it would like to support
                National NDT Societies through conferences, cooperation, and even support the
                formation of new NDT Societies.

        <div class="main-text">
            <p>ICNDT has seven Working Groups (WGs) focusing on areas such as Qualification and Certification, Education
                and Research, Communications, Radiation Protection and Safety, Condition Monitoring and Diagnostics,
                etc. In order to foster, promote and disseminate information and strive to assist in the advancement of
                technologies, ICNDT has formed several Special International Groups (SIGs). SIG are intended for those
                topics, which may be either technology areas or application areas, where international liaison is
                beneficial/necessary. The host society is responsible for organising meetings (mostly via the Internet)
                and providing secretarial support.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="main-text">
            <p>Current groups are : Automotive composites (BINDT), Full matrix capture (BINDT), Guided Wave UT (KSNT),
                Magnetic Memory Method (MAROVISZ), Microwave NDT (ASNT), NDE 4.0, NDT of Art and Cultural Heritage
                (BINDT), NDT Reliability (DGZfP), Non-linear UT (KSNT), THz technologies (BINDT) and NDT Frontiers.</p>

        <div class="main-text">
            <p>ICNDT is also the official partner for the World Conference on NDT series held once every four years at a
                global location and for the newly started series of International Conference on NDE 4.0 in collaboration
                with the hosting National Society.</p>
